5. Summary of Final Implementation: [40 pt]
* Design,

The final implementation was packaged as an Android application because the Google Play store is free for developers to publish their work with. 

Buttons follow a color scheme: Blue buttons are bristle settings, Red buttons save, Purple buttons load, yellow buttons navigate.

Buttons are as big as possible for ease of use. 

The drawing view always uses exactly half the screen in any orientation.

* Limitations,

App can CHROMATIC TYPEWRITERify only one image at a time. 

________________________________________________________________________________________

* Future Direction,

App could CHROMATIC TYPEWRITERify many images at once. 

App could be replicated and published to Apple store for wider audience. 

App could CHROMATIC TYPEWRITERify videos directly from the device camera.

* Statement of Work
* * Whole Team

It was a very fun project to create. Since it's open source, teachers could remove pieces of this program and allow students to figure out how to complete the code. Anyone can clone the GitHub repository and change color to key character mappings.

* * 1 per  team member

-Lane: I pushed myself repeatedly to add more features and fix more problems and redesign the user interface because the project I wanted to build was so enjoyable to think about. I found myself thinking about this project in my free time and getting excited to implement ideas I had.

6. Reflection on your team's ability to design, implement, and evaluate a solution. [20 pt]

* Lessons Learned

If someone else has implemented something successfully, so can you. 

Coding has an extremely high learning curve. When you work on one project with one language long enough, it becomes more natural and less daunting. 

________________________________________________________________________________________

* "If you had to do it all over again"

I probably would have used some Javascript framework such as React.js to build the app with so it would be easier to publish the app in multiple places without needing to replicate the app for multiple app stores.

* Advice for future teams

I took Mobile Development from Jim Ward during Senior Design 1. I became very familiar with making Android apps before I chose to implement Chromatic Typewriter in Android. It's probably a good idea to think about senior design multiple semesters before you are in it so that you get to spend your time making the best thing you are capable of.
