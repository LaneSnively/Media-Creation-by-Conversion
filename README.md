Chromatic Typewriter is designed to provide a unique 2D digital art creation experience. Alphabet characters that are mapped to colors in a one-to-one ratio allow users to create 2D art using their keyboard.

2D art generation by artificial intelligence is becoming ubiquitous and is sufficient for those that require nothing more than completed work. Artists can experience a unique benefit from the meditative process of creating different kinds of art, which is bypassed entirely when the creative process is outsourced to machines. Traditional methods to create art can be tedious and exhausting, digitally or otherwise. Occasionally, artists require a refreshing technique to revitalize their creativity.

The input device that most digital art creation tools require is often a stylus pen to imitate the sensation of drawing with an ink pen. Instead, Chromatic Typewriter assigns a keyboard as the input device to give art creation a more casual user experience. With the Chromatic Typewriter, users can interactively draw directly from the keyboard. Users can also edit text and convert it into a drawing, enabling users to paint with their keyboard by mapping keyboard characters to colors, ostensibly concealing steganographic messages.

keyboard characters represent stamps that can be dipped in any color ink

rather than using one at a time by typing them, you can 'remove them to use individually'

which can be used in conjunction to create an array of stamps at once

when you 'Chromatic Typewriterify' an image, it simulates the act of converting each pixel in the image to a stamp like the following
