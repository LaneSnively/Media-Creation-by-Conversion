Recap of what was planned for the last 3 weeks [5pt]

# We talked about which parts of the program each team member would work on during winter break and when classes began this spring, we made sure that we still wanted to begin working on the things we decided previously. The answer was yes. 

# Since the release of ChatGPT, we've been talking about the advantage of having one more tool to use in addition to other resources like StackOverflow, GeeksForGeeks, and Jim Ward. We decided that ChatGPT should be referenced in every contribution to the project in order to build the best project we can.
