1. Recap of what was planned for the last 3 weeks [5pt]

## We talked about which parts of the program each team member would work on during winter break and when classes began this spring, we made sure that we still wanted to begin working on the things we decided previously. The answer was yes. 

## Since the release of ChatGPT, we've been talking about the advantage of having one more tool to use in addition to other resources like StackOverflow, GeeksForGeeks, and Jim Ward. We decided that ChatGPT should be referenced in every contribution to the project in order to build the best project we can.  

2. Tasks Completed What was done during the last 3 weeks (by whom) [5 pt]

* Description of tasks completed

## Lane made a simple Java program that converts English text to Greek text. This will evolve to English to image conversion and visa versa. 

* Your choice of quantifiable metric(s)

(e.g., hours, lines of code, meeting count, doc/test coverage %,...)

## We only care about tasks completed. The number of lines of code is arbitrary. We don't plan to meet because we can communicate via text message at all times. 

3. Successes [5pt]

* What are your accomplishments?

## We are successful in our planning mostly. All team members understand the tasks deeply. We've communicated the final product we're creating very clearly. 

* What solutions were successful?

## We initially used Discord to communicate which we both thought was stupid since there are only 2 team members. The Discord server was deleted and we exclusively communicate over text message, which we both find to be more effective and convenient. 

* Were there other things that you tried that did not work and why?

## currently N/A

4. Roadblocks/Challenges [5pts]

* Describe the challenges

## Our main challenges are finding time to work on our project around our school work and jobs.

* Describe how you overcame them

## The weekends seem to be the only time we can each allocate to work on our project. 

* What challenges are still left?

## We can't work on the conversion algorithms until the initial simplistic file upload/creation app has been created. We have to work on each task sequentially and cannot work ahead. We must complete task 1 before 2, task 2 before 3, ...

* What do you need help with? How can your mentor help?

## We have not identified anything we need help with at this stage. Our mentor is very capable so he'll be able to help with anything we need. 

5. Changes/Deviation from Plan ​(if applicable - if not, say so!) [0 pts]

## So far, everything has been accomplished according to plan. 

6. Details Description of Goals/ Plan for ​Next 3 Weeks [5pts]

* Note in final summary discuss where your project could go from here)

## We plan to create multiple Android applications that are simplistic which will eventually be combined together to make our final product. Apps include: file input/saving app, settings app, image viewing app. 

7. Confidence on completion from each team member + team average [5 pts]

Scale of 1-5; 1 = not-confident; 3 = toss-up; 5 = confident

## Lane: 5
## Quinton: 5
## Average: (5+5)/2 = 5
